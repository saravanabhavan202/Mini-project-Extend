🔍 Abstract
This project presents a fingerprint-based student attendance system enhanced with GSM technology for real-time parent notifications. It captures student fingerprints, verifies identity, logs attendance, and instantly sends SMS updates to parents. The system improves reliability, eliminates proxy attendance, and simplifies administrative tasks with Excel-exportable reports.

🎯 Objective
To automate the student attendance process using biometric verification and notify parents via GSM module, ensuring accuracy, security, and improved communication between institutions and guardians.
